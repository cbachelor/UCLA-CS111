# UCLA-CS111

Repoistory contains projects I completed for CS 111 - Operating Systems Principles, as taught by Professor Mark Kampe in Spring 2017.
Solutions are my own, and may not be perfect. Using this resource will be at your own risk, and I strongly advise against copying.

Note that the files committed may not include all of the files necessary to test the code, i.e. if the files are modifications of 
pre-existing libraries, or run under a special enviornment. Generally every assignment includes a .txt file or .log file that explains 
the methods I followed to derive my solutions. All code was ran on the UCLA SEASnet Linux servers.

Lab 1 - Client/Server shell 
Lab 2 - Parallelism analysis 
Lab 3 - File system analysis (Completed with my parter Conner Borden)
